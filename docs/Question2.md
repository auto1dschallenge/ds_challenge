## Task:
Auto1 has a similar dataset (yet much larger...) 
Pick one of the use cases you listed in question 1 and describe how building a statistical model based on the dataset could best be used to improve Auto1’s business.


## Answer

#### Predicting the prize of a car
As discussed before, knowing the price a car will obtain when sold is the the cornerstone of Auto1's business model.
When dealing with buying and selling goods it is paramount to know the price for which a good can be sold.
This enables auto1 to decide how much to pay for a car given certain strategic goals, e.g.
* a certain profitability margin or desired profit would indicate a maximum buy price below the predicted selling price.
* if the goal is to increase turnover or sales volume a buy price higher then the sell price might be acceptable.

No matter the specific strategic goal, without good information on the sell price of a car, no informed decisions can be undertaken when it comes to the offered buying price.
